## Multiple Year Stock Data

I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
-The ticker symbol
-Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-Highlights positive change in green and negative change in red for the yearly change column.
-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The total stock volume of the stock.

Then I added functionality to my scrip to return the stocks with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

I then created a loop that would run the above loops on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
